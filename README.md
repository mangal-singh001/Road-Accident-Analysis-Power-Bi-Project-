# 🚦 Road Accident Analysis – Power BI Project

## 📌 Overview

This project presents a **comprehensive analysis of road accident data** using **Power BI**.  
The goal is to uncover **trends, hotspots, and risk factors** to help make data-driven decisions for road safety.

The interactive Power BI dashboard allows you to explore accident data by:
- 📅 **Time** – yearly, monthly, and hourly trends  
- 🗺 **Location** – accident hotspots on the map  
- 🚗 **Vehicle Type** – contribution to accidents  
- ⚠️ **Severity & Casualties** – key safety indicators

## 🧠 Data & Methodology

### 📊 Dataset
- Source: `compressed_data.csv.gz` (decompress before using)
- Contains information such as **location, date, time, vehicle type, casualties**, and more.

### 🛠 Analysis Steps
1. **Data Cleaning & Transformation**  
   - Removed invalid/missing values  
   - Converted data types & derived new fields

2. **Power BI Modeling**  
   - Loaded data into Power BI  
   - Created relationships and DAX measures

3. **Visualization**  
   - Mapped accident locations  
   - Built KPIs, charts, and interactive visuals

4. **Insight Generation**  
   - Identified accident hotspots  
   - Analyzed peak accident times  
   - Highlighted contributing factors
