## 🚦 Project Overview

This repository hosts a Power BI dashboard project that performs an analysis of road accident data. The goal is to derive insights about accident trends, risk factors, and patterns — enabling data-driven decisions to improve road safety.

The project includes:

- `Road Accident Analysis.pbix` — the main Power BI report/dashboard file  
- `compressed_data.csv.gz` — the compressed dataset used in the project  
- Visual assets: `Dashboard.png`, background image file, vehicle images folder, etc.  
- Supporting images and resources for the visual design

## 📊 Data & Methodology

### Dataset

- The dataset (`compressed_data.csv.gz`) contains records of road accidents (e.g., location, date, time, vehicle types, casualties, etc.).
- It has been compressed to reduce size; decompress before use in Power BI.

### Steps in the Analysis

1. **Data preprocessing & cleaning**  
   - Filtering or removing invalid or missing entries  
   - Converting data types (dates, numeric fields)  
   - Deriving new variables (e.g. accident severity, time-of-day categories)

2. **Data import into Power BI**  
   - Loading the dataset  
   - Applying transformations using Power Query (if necessary)  

3. **Model & relationships**  
   - Define tables and relationships  
   - Create measures and calculated columns (DAX)  

4. **Visualizations & dashboard design**  
   - Maps to show accident distribution  
   - Time series charts (trends by year, month, hour)  
   - Breakdown by vehicle type, severity, cause, etc.  
   - Key performance indicators (KPIs) and summary metrics  

5. **Insights & findings**  
   - Observations about accident hotspots  
   - Temporal patterns (peak hours, months)  
   - Risk factors (vehicles, road conditions)

## 🛠 How to Use / Reproduce

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mangal-singh001/Road-Accident-Analysis-Power-Bi-Project-.git
  ````

2. Decompress `compressed_data.csv.gz` to extract the `.csv`.

3. Open `Road Accident Analysis.pbix` in Power BI Desktop (version X or later recommended).

4. If necessary, re-link or refresh the data source to the decompressed .csv file.

5. Explore the report, interact with visuals, and optionally extend or customize it.

## ✅ Key Features / Highlights

* Interactive map visualizations showing geographical distribution of accidents
* Trend analysis over time (daily, monthly, yearly)
* Breakdown by vehicle type, severity, and other relevant attributes
* KPI cards summarizing totals and rates
* Design elements including custom backgrounds and images

---

## ℹ️ Requirements & Compatibility

* **Power BI Desktop** (latest or a version compatible with the `.pbix`)
* Sufficient memory & processing power to handle the dataset
* The `.pbix` may include custom visuals; ensure those visuals are supported in your version

---

## ✍️ Customization & Extension Ideas

* Add filters for region, time, weather conditions, etc.
* Incorporate external datasets (e.g., weather, traffic volume, population density)
* Develop forecasting or predictive models (e.g. accident likelihood)
* Publish the report via Power BI Service, embed in web portals
* Enhance interactivity (tooltips, drill-throughs, bookmarks)
